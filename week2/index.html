    <p style="text-align: left;">Sierra Leone still suffers from the consequences of a civil war which has resulted in a lagging school system with a
        very low level of education. Our goal is to help children from poor families get a high-level education
        to fight against poverty.
        Our strategy consists of selecting a few motivated children from poor families and supporting them. We have two
        support approaches:
        1) Support to retake the Brevet and Bac with support courses after a failure.
